In this jupyter notebook we use Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc. 

Start by cleaning our data-
- Drop NaN values from DataFrame
- Removing rows based on a condition
- Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)

Next is the Data exploration. Analysing the data based on Business questions- 
- What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
- What city sold the most product?
- What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customers buying product?
- What products are most often sold together?
- What product sold the most? 

Analysing these help us give useful insights for the business which inturn helps it in increasing the sales.
